# Evolutionary-Art

Explore the fascinating world of evolutionary algorithms by witnessing the evolution of the iconic "Mona Lisa" image. This project employs a novel approach, leveraging evolutionary principles to generate art. Through a process of population initialization, iterative selection, crossover, and mutation, the algorithm refines randomly generated image representations, aiming to converge towards a replica of the original masterpiece. Dive into the world of digital evolution and witness the creation of art through computation.

# Key Features:

Evolutionary algorithm implementation for image evolution
Population initialization with random chromosome representations
Iterative selection, crossover, and mutation processes
Objective-driven evolution to minimize differences from the original "Mona Lisa"
Get involved in the evolution of art and explore the convergence of technology and creativity with our Mona Lisa Evolution project!
